%% Task 0-3 assignment
% 
%    1. Let the image area has an extent [1, 1] to [800, 600].
%    2. Chose a planar line in general position, suitably inside the image.
%    3. Randomly generate a set of 800 points belonging to the line. The points are polluted by an isotropic gaussian noise with Ïƒ=3 [px]
%    4. Randomly generate an additional set of 200 outlying points, uniformly distributed over the image area.
%    5. Mix all the points together.
%    6. Use the set of all points for (non-robust) ML estimation of the line. Use numeric optimisation (fminsearch)).
%    7. Use the set of all points for robust ML estimation of the line. Use ransac to separate inliers and outliersf and than numeric optimisation on the inliers.
%    8. Plot the whole situation:
%           * Original line
%           * Points
%           * Line found by non-robust ML estimation.
%           * Line found by robust ML estimation.
